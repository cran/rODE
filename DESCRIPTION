        S4 Classes

Description: Show Physics and engineering students how an ODE solver
    is made and how effective classes can be for the construction of
    the equations that describe how effective classes can be for the 
    construction of equations that describe the natural phenomena. Most 
    of the ideas come from the book on "Computer Simulations in Physics" 
    by Harvey Gould, Jan Tobochnik, and Wolfgang Christian.
