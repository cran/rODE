AdaptiveStepApp   Adaptive step example using RK45 ODE solver.
CompareRK45App   Compares the solution by the RK45 ODE solver versus the analytical solution.
CompareRK45ODEApp   Updates the ODE state instead of using the internal state in the ODE solver. Also plots the solver solution versus the analytical solution at a tolerance of 1e-6.
FallingParticleApp   Application that simulates the free fall of a ball using Euler ODE solver.
KeplerApp   Solves an inverse-square law model (Kepler model) using an adaptive stepsize algorithm. Application showing two planet orbiting.
KeplerDormandPrince45App   Demonstration of the use of ODE solver RK45 for a particle subjected to a inverse-law force. The difference with the example KeplerApp is we are seeing the effect in thex and y axis on the particle. The original routine used the Verlet ODE solver.
KeplerEnergyApp   Demonstration of the use of the Verlet ODE solver.
LogisticApp   Simulates the logistic equation.
PendulumApp   Simulation of a pendulum using the EulerRichardson ODE solver.
PendulumEulerApp   Pendulum simulation with the Euler ODE solver, Notice how Euler is not applicable in this case as it diverges very quickly even when it is using a very small delta-t ODE.
PlanetApp   Simulation of Earth orbiting around the Sun using the Euler ODE solver.
ProjectileApp   Simulation with RK4 originally uses Euler ODE solver.
ReactionApp   Solves an autocatalytic oscillating chemical reaction (Brusselator model) using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.
RigidBodyNXFApp   Example of a non-stiff system is the system of equations describing the motion of a rigid body without external forces.
SHOApp   Single Harmonic Oscillator simulation that uses DormandPrince45 solver along with a ODE selector ODESolverFactory.
SpringRK4App   Simulation of a spring considering no friction using the Runge-Kutta ODE solver.
VanderpolMuTimeControlApp   This is a modification of the original Vanderpol.R script. In this version, we will add tha ability of setting mu and time lapse. This example is also shown in the Matlab help guide.
